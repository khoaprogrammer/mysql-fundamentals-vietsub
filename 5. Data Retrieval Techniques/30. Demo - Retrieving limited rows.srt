00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Here we are in MySQL Workbench in SQL Editor and we are going to see how LIMIT keyword works.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
As mentioned earlier, LIMIT keyword is a pretty straightforward keyword. Let's first retrieve data from

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
sakila.actor, where we have ORDER BY clause on actor_id. Let's go and apply LIMIT 10. What it does is that when

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
we execute this statement, it will only retrieve 10 rows; however, what happens if you want to retrieve data,

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which is somewhere in-between the table? What it means is that you want to retrieve row #30 to 35 or row #50 to 65.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
At that time, you can additionally specify offset to the LIMIT clause. This is how it works. Look at this example

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
where we have LIMIT 15 and 10. Well, these have two parameters. Let's execute them and understand what each of

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
these parameters do. When you execute this query, you can see that the first record is no more actor_id 1,

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
it is now actor_id 16. The first parameter, which we provided to LIMIT keyword, is offset. What it means is that

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
if you specify you had 15, MySQL would skip first 15 lines and would start reading the lines after that.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Here, if I specify 10, what it means is that is only going to retrieve 10 rows. Let's change this number and see

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
one more example. For that, I'm going to put here 25 and number of the rows I'm going to put 5.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What it will do is that it will start retrieving rows from row #26 and will retrieve till row #30 because we are

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
going to retrieve only five rows. Now, let's select this one and click on Execute. As we expected, it is

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
retrieving us five rows from the actor_id 26 and onwards. As LIMIT clause limits the number of the rows it

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
retrieves from the offset, it also helps with performance of overall server health. Well, with this we end our

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
understanding of data retrieval and it's various clauses, phrase, and operators. In the next module, we will see

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:59:00,000
data modification techniques and now we end this module with summary in sixty seconds.
