Hi, this is Pinal Dave for Pluralsight. In this module, we will discuss about various Data Retrieval Techniques.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
For any IDBMS, data retrieval is the most essential task. In an earlier module, we learned we can use MySQL

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Workbench to retrieve and modify data. MySQL Workbench is a great tool for developers who have to deal

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
with the data. For any application, you have to write scripts in SQL to retrieve or modify data.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
SQL stands for Structure Query Language. In this module, we will learn how to code SELECT statement and

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
retrieve data. It is very important to have proper understanding of how SELECT statement works and

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
its building blocks. All the concepts, which we learn about SELECT statement, applies to update and delete

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
statements, which we will explore in the next module of data modification. Let's start to understand the basics

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
of SELECT statement and it's most essential building blocks -- WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT.
