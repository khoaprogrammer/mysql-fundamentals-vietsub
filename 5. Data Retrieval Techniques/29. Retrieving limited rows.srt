00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now we have reached to very last concept, which we want to learn in this module, which is LIMIT clause.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We can use LIMIT clause to limit the number of the rows that are returned by SELECT statement.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This clause usually has one or two arguments. Each of them has different meaning and we will understand them

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
while we do demonstration. It's always recommended that we use ORDER BY along with LIMIT because there is no

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
guarantee when we use LIMIT that we are going to get the data in the same order in every subsequent execution

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
of the same SELECT statement. The frequent use of this LIMIT clause is when we are doing paging.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Think about it this way. If there are 1000 rows in one table and now you want to retrieve only row, which is

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
between 500 and 510, how would you go about retrieving them? Well, this is the time that you use the LIMIT clause

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
because LIMIT clause has a two-argument, one is number of the rows and second one is offset.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Let's quickly understand both of them in demonstration.
