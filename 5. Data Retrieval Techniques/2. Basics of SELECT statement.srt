00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Developers use SELECT statement for various purposes. Here is a list of few of the examples where we use

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
SELECT statement: Retrieve static value, retrieve all the data from table, retrieve all the data ordered

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
by single column, retrieve selected columns from table, retrieve data with filter condition, retrieve the data

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
with filter condition and ordered by multiple columns, retrieve empty resultset.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In this module, we will see examples of this, as well as a few real-world scenarios.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let's start with understanding basic syntax of SELECT statement.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
A basic SELECT statement has five clauses. SELECT clause: It describes the column in resultset.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
FROM clause: Names the base table from which the query retrieves data. We can also use views here, but that's

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
advanced concept. WHERE clause: It specifies the condition that must be met for any row to be retrieved in

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
resultset. ORDER BY clause: It specifies how to sort the rows in resultset. We can have one column or multiple

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
columns, by which we can order resultset. LIMIT clause: It specifies the number of the rows to return.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sometimes tables are very huge and it's important that we retrieve only a limited number of the rows for

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
various reasons. In Basic Syntax of SELECT statement, we have not included all the clauses in this Basic Syntax of

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
SELECT statement. For example, HAVING clause: HAVING clause filters data based on aggregate functions.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
In our advanced course, we will be talking about aggregate function. At the same time we will explore HAVING clause

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and also understand difference between WHERE clause and HAVING clause. Now let's see SELECT statement in action.
