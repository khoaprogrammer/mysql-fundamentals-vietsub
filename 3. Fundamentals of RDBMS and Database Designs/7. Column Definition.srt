00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Column definition is very important. We create Primary Key, Unique Key, Foreign Key, and Indexes on column.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Column definition is very critical when we talk about performance. In column definition, data type determines

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
the type of information we store in column. For example, we have various kinds of data types -- string, integer,

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
float, date and time. We can store any character string in CHAR or VARCHAR data type and then store any

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
numeric value in integer data type. If you have decimal value, we can put them in a float and if we have date

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:47,000
data type, for example, birthday or anniversary date or joining date, we can use date and time date data type.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Along with data type, there are a few important properties of column definition as well. Let's look at them.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Default Value. We can specify a default value for any column. Let's see a scenario where you have a requirement

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
to log current date/time of data inserted into a table. You can create a column with the name ‘insert a date'

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and by default give it a value of ‘current date/time'. What it means is that every single time any data, which is

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
inserted into that table, the column ‘insert a date' will be automatically populated with default value,

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
but not every column qualifies for default value. There are cases where you may not know what to put in a column.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
At that time, you can leave the column as NULL. This is called NULLable column. Now, you can have a default value

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
in the column or you can just leave the column NULL and there won't be any data there.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You can later go and update either this default value or NULL value.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Auto increment column: Auto increment column is a column which is continuously increasing by the interval,

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
which we specified in the column definition. Auto increment column is very important because in many cases

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
it is difficult to identify column qualifying for Primary Key. In that case, we can add an auto increment column.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Now, auto increment column will not have a NULL value. Additionally, it will be always incrementing distinct value.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This is a good candidate for Primary Key. Personally, I believe defining column data types and column properties

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
is one of the most essential tasks for any database designer. With this, we complete understanding of our last

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:59:00,000
concept in Fundamentals of Database Design.
