1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Here you can see I have already downloaded MySQL Installer. Let's double-click it and it brings up Welcome screen.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now we'll follow a Standard MySQL installation. Click on Install MySQL Products, read and agree to license terms,

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
click on Next, and it will ask you if you want to check for latest updates. As I've just downloaded my package,

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
there won't be any update, even though it does not harm to check it one more time.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's click on Execute, it will connect to the internet and fetch product update information.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Over here, it gives us various options for setup types. Developer options, it installs all products needed for

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
MySQL development purposes. This is one which we'll be selecting. However, it's worth noting there are other

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:58,000
options like server only, client only, a full installation, and custom installation. Two more things to note

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
before we click on Next, first is Installation Path and second is Data Path. Installation Path is where MySQL

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
will install MySQL and Data Path is where MySQL will install data files. Click on Next.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
On the prerequisite screen, it will give us a list of all the prerequisites. In my case, all the prerequisites

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
are met, hence, we are seeing all green checkmarks. Let's click on Next. Now we'll be installing MySQL and

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
all the related product. I would like you to pay close attention to the time it takes to install MySQL Server.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The reason is that, after I click on Execute, you'll notice that installing MySQL Server and all the

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:54,000
related product is a very fast and efficient process. Let's click on Execute. (Music)

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And we're done. You can see in very few seconds, we installed MySQL Server and all the related products.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Isn't it easy and efficient? Let's click on Next. Here it will ask us to do configuration.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
After installation, configuration is a very important task. However, MySQL configuration is very simple to do.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Click on Next. Here, you are to select your server configuration type. We have Development Machine so

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
we'll leave the Development Machine as a default option. Alternatively, you can also select Server Machine or

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Dedicated Machine as well. In the Server Machine, you'll have other applications also running with

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
MySQL installation; however, in case of the Dedicated Machine, only MySQL product will be running on this machine.

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
My machine is Development Machine, hence, click Development Machine and click on Next.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Here, you can enable or disable TCP/IP Networking. Let's not change any setting over here and click on Next.

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
MySQL Server Configuration will ask us to enter Root Password and you can see password strength is medium.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let me create another admin user over here. I'll give the name Pinal Dave. I left the role â€˜DB Admin'.

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll provide a complex password. Click OK and now we are ready to go to next screen. Click on Next.

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
On this screen, MySQL will allow us to configure Windows Service Details. Here, we will change the

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Windows Service Name so we can easily identify our MySQL installation. We will give it the name as SQLAuthority.

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Now click on Next. Here you can see now Server Configuration is complete. We can click Next one more time and

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Samples and Examples will be configured. Click on Next and now, along with MySQL Server Samples and Examples,

32
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
we are ready to go. Click on Next. On the very next screen it will ask us if you want to start MySQL Workbench

33
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
after Setup, yes or no. I'll leave this one on because that's the next thing which we are going to discuss.

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Click Finish and immediately you can see MySQL Workbench is open.
