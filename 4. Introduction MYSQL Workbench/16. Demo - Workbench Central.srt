00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now we understand the three major sections of MySQL Workbench -- SQL Development, Data Modeling,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and Server Administration. Now we will understand Workbench Central. Click over here and you can see there are

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
various links for Workbench Central. The first one is MySQL Doc Library. Click over here and it will open

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
MySQL Documentation. You can pretty much search anything over here and this is a great reference.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
For example, let's search for ‘alter index' and when we search for alter index, it gives us 24 matches and all of them

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
showed up instantaneously. Let's do another search. Let's search for ‘create database'. There are more than 50

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
results for ‘create database'. If you are doing MySQL code and if you're stuck, I strongly encourage you to

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
refer to MySQL Workbench Reference Manual. There is a good chance that it will solve all of your problems.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's close this and go to Home Page.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The second link over here is MySQL Utility. When we click over here, it displays us a list of MySQL Utilities.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
They are very important. For example, there are utilities for identifying difference, auditing administration

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
or doing import or export. Let's close it and here is the link for Database Migration.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
When you click over here, it opens MySQL Workbench Migration Wizard. This wizard assists us in migrating table

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and data from supported database system to MySQL. You can also use this one to copy database from one

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
MySQL instance to another MySQL instance. Let's close this one.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Similarly, we can submit MySQL Bug from MySQL Workbench itself, as well as for additional tips and tricks,

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
we can read Workbench blogs. Now we are back on the main screen of MySQL Workbench. With this, we conclude this

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:59:00,000
module and move to Summary.
