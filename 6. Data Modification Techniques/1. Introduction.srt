Hi, this is Pinal Dave for Pluralsight and in this module, we will discuss about Data Modification Techniques.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Our major focus in this module will be on INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE Statement. With UPDATE and DELETE, we will

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
be also using WHERE clause. All the operators and phrases, which we have learned in an earlier module, will apply

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
over here as it is. Each of the statements have two clear distinct areas. The first area is how to modify

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:38,000
a single row and second area is how to modify multiple rows. Also, it's not a good idea to modify your live data.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
For the same reason, I'll be creating a sample table and will be doing all the operations on top of sample table.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Let's start with INSERT Statement.
