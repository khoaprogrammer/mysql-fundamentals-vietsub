1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Now we will see how we can edit SQL Script in SQL Editor. Go to MySQL Workbench home screen.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Click on Edit SQL Script. Let's select SQLAuthority as your Stored Connection and click on Next.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Over here it will ask us ‘Please select SQL file you want to open'. I already created a SQL file, which I'll

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
select from this Browse menu. I selected the file ‘Test1.sql'. There is an option if I want to execute this file

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
upon opening. I'll select this one as I know this one is safe to execute. I strongly recommend that don't select

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
this checkbox if you are not sure about the content of the file, which you are opening. Now click on Finish.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It has executed the SQL, which was part of TEST1.sql. In the TEST1.sql, I had a very simple SELECT statement.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It was SELECT * FROM sakila.actor. It will list us all the actors. Let's write another SELECT over here

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and now we will save this file. Let's close TEST1 and now we will open the same file once again.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Go to ‘Open a SQL script file in a new query tab' with a second option in Menu over here and open TEST1 once again.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You can see that TEST1.sql now has two SELECT statements. Let's execute them together.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Select these two statements and click on Execute. Now let's look at our Visual Pane. On Visual Pane, you can see

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
there are two tabs also over here. One is actor 1 and second one is city 2. One and two is just indicating the

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
order of the query, how they're executed. They are just an indication. You can reorder them as well.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Actor is now listing all the actors and city is now listing all the cities. Working with SQL Editor is indeed

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:59:00,000
very easy.
