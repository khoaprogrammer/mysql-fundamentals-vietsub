00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now we will see how we can use star and retrieve all the data from the table.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Here is an example, ‘SELECT * FROM sakila.actor'. When we use a star and do not provide any filter condition

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
using WHERE, this statement will retrieve every single column and every single row from sakila.actor table.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Select the statement and click on Execute. You can see it is retrieving all the four columns and all the 200 rows

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
from sakila.actor table. Let's take another example. We can also retrieve all the rows and all the columns from

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
sakila.city table. Select the statement and click on Execute. Well if you noticed, we are using sakila.city name.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This naming convention is database.tablename. If you don't want to keep on using sakila in a name of this table,

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
you can use another technique. For example, here I'm using ‘USE sakila'. When we execute this statement,

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
it will by default sakila database as a database for every subsequent execution of statement.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's see that into action, but first, pay attention on the left side in Object Browser.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You can see sakila, test, and world, all three have similar fonts. Now, let's execute ‘USE sakila'.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
When you execute this one, at that time, now sakila is highlighted or bold. What it means is that now sakila

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
is default context for every single execution after this statement. When we execute this one, it will retrieve as

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
same data, which we got from ‘SELECT * FROM sakila.city'. USE database name is a good idea to execute if you know

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
every subsequent execution you are going to do from same database. Let's close this and now in the next clip,

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:59:00,000
we will retrieve all of the data ordered by single column. (Typing)
