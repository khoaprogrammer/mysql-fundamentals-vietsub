Let's see a tricky example. I've seen a lot of developer writing SELECT * FROM table name where they just want

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
to see what kind of column table has. When you run SELECT * FROM table, it will pretty much retrieve every single

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
row and every single data from the complete table. This is not a good idea if you just want to know what are the

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
names of the column. The very quick trick would be, over here, is to just write ‘WHERE 1 = 2'.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
When you write ‘WHERE 1 = 2' at that time, MySQL will not return you any data because 1 = 2 is always a false condition.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's good to understand that you can write this kind of query and get empty resultset.
