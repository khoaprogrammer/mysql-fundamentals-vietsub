We can use UPDATE statement to update one or more rows in a table. The SET clause in UPDATE statement will

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
contain name of the column and its new value, whereas WHERE clause will have a condition, which qualifies rows

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to be updated to a new value. Just like INSERT, we have a concept of default and NULL here as well and they work

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
almost exactly the same. Let's see UPDATE in action. UPDATE has many variations. For example, update single row

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and single column, update single row and multiple columns, we can also update multiple rows in single column or

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
update multiple rows in multiple columns. We can use SELECT subquery in UPDATE statement as well.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Let's see all of this into action now.
