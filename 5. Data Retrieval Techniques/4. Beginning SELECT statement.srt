00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Now, let's see some of the SELECT statement into action. We will go over some of the basic and simple

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
SELECT statements in the beginning, later we will see more complicated examples. First, we will see how we can

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
use SELECT statement to retrieve static values. Later, we will use SELECT statement to retrieve all the data from

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
table using star. The same retrieved data, we will order by single column. Later, we will only select

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
selected columns instead of all the column from the table. Right after that, we will make sure the data,

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
which we will retrieve, is not all the data. We will write a filter condition on the top of the SELECT statement

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and retrieve only selected rows. After that, we will combine all of our learning and retrieve data for

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
selected column using filter condition and with order by multiple columns. Finally, we will see a simple trick

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
where we will retrieve empty resultset using SELECT statement. Now let's see a demonstration where we will see

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:59:00,000
each of them in action. Now let's open MySQL Workbench.
