DELETE statement is one of the most powerful statements. It can delete every single row in your table pretty

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
SELECT statement to qualify row to delete in DELETE statement. If we forget the WHERE clause, we'll pretty much

delete every single row from the table. Let's see all of this concept into action next.
