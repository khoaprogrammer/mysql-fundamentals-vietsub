We will be using SQL to access MySQL Database. At that time, the system is often called Client/Server System.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's understand Client/Server System. There are three important components for any Client/Server System.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Clients: Clients are like PCs, Macs, laptops, tablets, smartphones, etc.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Server: Server usually stores files. When Server stores database along with files, it is called Database Server.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
MySQL is Database Server application.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Networks: Networks are communication links between Client and Server. Beside including lines and cables,

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Network also includes hubs, router, and other interface components. In many enterprises, large database files

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
are also stored on a network storage. Networking components connect server with network storage.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,000
In simple topology, client and server are both on a same network. They are often known as land or local area network.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If there are more than two lands located in a separate geographic location, that's called WAN, which is

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
wide area network. If we assume there is a database on this Client/Server System, we can say that client sends

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
a request in terms of the SQL query to the server. Server, in turn, passes the same SQL query to the database

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and database query returns the results back to the client and then the client, which can be PC, Mac,

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:59:00,000
audio handheld devices, will display the result.
