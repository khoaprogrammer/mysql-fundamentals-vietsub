Hi, this is Pinal Dave for Pluralsight. In this module, we will talk about Summary and Resources.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So far, we have learned Installation of MySQL Server, MySQL Workbench, and MySQL Sample Databases.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
All of these components and all other components are installed by default.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Later, we learned MySQL Workbench and three of its major sections -- SQL Development, where we connected to

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
existing database and ran SQL queries; Data Modeling, where we created and managed EER models;

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Server Administration, where we configured Database Server and set up user accounts.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Later, we spent time on Relational Database Management System and Database Design Concepts.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We also learned in depth various techniques for data retrieval. In Data Retrieval Techniques, we focused on

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT clauses. Finally, we spent a lot of time on Data Modification Techniques.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We learned how we can modify our data using INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, here are a few of the important resources.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, I thank you very, very much for spending time learning with me, MySQL Fundamentals Part 1.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
In Part 2 of MySQL Introduction, we will learn Joins, Functions, Views, Transactions, Stored Procedures,

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Stored Functions, Triggers and Events. Thank you and we will meet in MySQL Introduction Part 2.
