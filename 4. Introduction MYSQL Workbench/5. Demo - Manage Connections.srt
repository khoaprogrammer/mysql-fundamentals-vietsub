1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Well, we just noticed that we have created a new connection, which is SQLAuthority. As you keep on using MySQL

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
in your production environment and development environment, you will notice that the number of the connections

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
you work with keep on increasing. At one point, you may want to delete, create or modify your existing connection.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You can easily manage all of the connections from your MySQL Workbench. Under SQL Development Area, go to

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Manage Connections and click over here. It will bring up this screen. You can see on the left side there is a

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
SQLAuthority connection. This is the only connection we have created so far. Let's click over here.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Once we clicked, you can see all the information from this connection is filled up on the right side.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You can also configure a few of the advanced connections over here by clicking over Advanced Tab.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
As this is a fundamental course, we will be not spending much of the time on this tab. Let's go back on Parameters.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Also on the bottom of the screen, you can see there are a few options -- New creates new connection,

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Delete deletes existing connection. Let's create one more connection. I'll click on New and new connection is

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
isolated on the left side, as well as it has populated few of the default value on the right side of the screen.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Let's give Connection Name as Pluralsight. We'll give Connection Method as a Standard (TCP/IP).

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
In the Host Name, I would reckon leave this one as it is or we can provide Local Host as a Host Name.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We'll keep Username, Root, and the Password. Click OK and in this case, we'll also give a Default Schema.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We will use Default Schema as sakila. Now, let's click on Test Connection and our test is successful.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Click OK and now you can close this one. On the main screen, you can see that now we have two databases,

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
one is SQLAuthority and second one is Pluralsight. Let's change the order of SQLAuthority and Pluralsight in

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Manage Connection. Click on Manage Connection and now let's click on Pluralsight on the left side in

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Stored Connection area and click on Move Up. You can see that Pluralsight is now on the top and SQLAuthority

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
is on bottom. Click Close and on the main screen, the order is also changed. Now double-click on newly created

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Pluralsight connection and you can notice that sakila is highlighted. What it means is that sakila database is

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:59:00,000
now by default selected. Now let's go back to home screen.
