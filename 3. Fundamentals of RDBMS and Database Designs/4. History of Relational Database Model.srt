00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We noticed that Database Management System plays a very important role in any application.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
There are two kinds of database models -- Relational Database Model and Non-Relational Database Model.

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
MySQL is a Relational Database Model. Let's quickly see a couple of history bites before we move to

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
understanding relational database management system concept in depth.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In 1970, Dr. E.F. Code has developed the concepts of relational database.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Any relational database will help following three most important properties.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There will be less redundancy between the data, retrieval of the data will be very efficient, and

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
the data modification should be intuitive. Though relational database can get complex, the basic three

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
properties of less redundancy, efficient data retrieval, and intuitive data modification usually stays the same

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
because relational database concepts enforces them. Let's see what are the relational database concepts in depth.
