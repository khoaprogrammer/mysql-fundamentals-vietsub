We use INSERT Statement when we are to add one or more rows to a table. To insert a single row, we can specify

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
INSERT command with table name and column list followed by the data, which we want to insert.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Also, we can use SELECT statement to populate another table as well. When we want to insert multiple rows,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
at the same time, same logic applies. We can use one insert in multiple VALUE clause or SELECT statement,

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
which returns us multiple rows. There are two important things to keep into focus while learning about

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
INSERT Statement -- one is Default Values and second is NULL Values. We will understand all of these things

00:00:41,000 --> 00:59:00,000
in demonstration next.
