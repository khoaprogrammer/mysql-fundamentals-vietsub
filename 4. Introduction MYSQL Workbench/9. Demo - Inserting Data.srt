00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Now we will learn how we can insert a new row using SQL Editor. Go to Schema or database sakila, click on Tables,

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
right-click on Actors, and select ‘Select Rows'. It has written us rows from table, actor.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now on the Visual Tab, you can see on the top bar there is a menu. The first menu states ‘Edit current row',

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
which we have seen it earlier, and now go to the next one. There's a small plus sign on table grid there.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The pop states ‘Insert new row'. Click over here. At the end of the table it has given us a new row.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Here I'll insert a new id, 1000, name is Pinal, last name is Dave, and last updated date, let's put any date.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now the logical Apply and Cancel is still there. Click on Apply if you want to insert this row.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll click on Apply and it has automatically generated INSERT script for us. Now you can see the INSERT script

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
has been generated. You can see the values when you scroll down the right side. Now click on Apply and

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
click on Finish. Now you can see Apply and Cancel at this table. If you go to the end of it, you can see

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:59:00,000
the new row has been inserted. In the next clip, we will see how we can delete the newly inserted row.
