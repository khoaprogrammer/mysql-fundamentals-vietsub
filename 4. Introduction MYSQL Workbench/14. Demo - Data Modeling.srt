00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So far we have been seeing features from SQL Development section. Let us see how Data Modeling section works.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We'll create an EER Model from existing database. Let's click over here and select our preferred connection.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'll select SQLAuthority, click on Next, and it has successfully connected to DBMS. Additionally, it has also

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
retrieved schema lists from database. Click on Next and you can see all the schema which exists in MySQL Database.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let's select sakila and click on Next. You can see on this screen that it has successfully retrieved all the

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
object from sakila schema. Click on Next. On this page, it is asking us, what are the objects which we want to

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
use for reverse engineering? We can select Tables, Views, Routines, and Trigger. Just for this example, I will

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
leave all of them checked and click on Execute. You can see that it has successfully executed

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
reverse engineering task. Click on Next and we can see the Success Message. Now, for last time, click on Finish.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Here is our EER diagram. Well, currently all the objects are over each other. Let's select all of them by

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
typing CTRL A. Now go to Arrange and click on Autolayout. It will automatically layout each of these tables,

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
along with their relationships. Let's go to city table and click on Indexes. Click on Indexes and you can see

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
there is only a Primary Key over here. EER diagrams are very interesting to read. Let's go back to the main screen

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:59:00,000
of MySQL Workbench.
