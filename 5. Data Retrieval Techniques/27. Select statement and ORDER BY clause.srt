The ORDER BY clause specifies sort order of the resultset. The sort order can be ascending or descending.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Additionally, we can sort the resultset by one column or multiple columns. We can also use various expressions

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
in ORDER BY clause as well. ORDER BY clause is the only clause where we can use alias to sort columns as well.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Additionally, we can use column number to specify sort order as well. ORDER BY clause has a very special behavior

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
with NULL values. NULL values always appear first in the sort sequence. It does not matter if you specify

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
sort sequence, ascending or descending. Additionally, remember that you can sort any column in the base table

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
regardless if you have used that one in the SELECT statement or not. Let's see some of the interesting examples of

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:59:00,000
how ORDER BY clause works in the next demonstration.
