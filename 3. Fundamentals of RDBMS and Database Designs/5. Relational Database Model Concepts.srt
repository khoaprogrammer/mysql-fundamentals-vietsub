For any relational database model, there are four very important concepts. A model for relational database states

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
the data is storing one or more tables. It also states that each table is two-dimensional.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Each dimensions are columns and rows. Intersection of the columns and rows are cells.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's see them a little bit more in detail. A table: Any relational database consists of one or more tables.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Tables are usually modeled after real world entities. For example, an address table would have

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Address 1, Address 2, City, State, Country, and Zip code or Postal Code. It's quite possible on a single

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
address, one or many different persons are staying. It's quite possible that there is nobody staying at

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the address as well. Address can have different types, like Work, Home, Factory or Open Ground.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Well, all of them can be tables. A column: A column represents some attribute of the entity of the table.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
For example, in the case of the address, as we discussed, it can be Street #, Apartment #, Address 1,

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
City, Zip code or any other detail. Columns are also known as fields. A row usually contains a set of values

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
for a single instance of entity. For example, in address table it will have a single address.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
A single address may contain multiple columns. An address can be Apartment #, followed by Street #, followed by City,

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,000
State, and Zip code. If the table has multiple Countries data, then there may be an additional column for Country

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and the row will contain Name of the Country. Well, this discussion leads to our last discussion about cells.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Cells are nothing but intersection of row and column. One cell may contain Apartment # and another cell may

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
contain Street #. They can belong to different columns and they can belong to different rows.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It is just an intersection and each of the cells will have a single value. Well, think about it this way.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Apartment # may be a number, but street name may not be a #, but may be a string. Now we are leading to another

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
concept that cell can have different kinds of value. It can be a number or it can be a string or

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
it's quite possible it's a mix of both of them. In relational database, everything into the table has a

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:59:00,000
relation to each other, as well as there is a relation among the tables. Well let's see that in the next clip.
