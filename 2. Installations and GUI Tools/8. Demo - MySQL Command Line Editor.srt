00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now let's see a simple example how we'll use MySQL Command Line Client when we don't have access to

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
MySQL Workbench. When you open MySQL Command Line Client, the very first thing it will ask is Password.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Enter your password, hit Enter, and it will bring you to a command prompt. If you want further help over here,

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
you can type ‘help;' and it will give you pretty much every single help available for this command prompt.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now let's try to see what are the different databases installed on this server.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
For that, we will be using a command called show. Type ‘show databases' and click on Enter.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It will list all the databases which we have. Let's use the word ‘database'. Type ‘use world' and hit Enter.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You can see the message displayed ‘Database changed'. Now let's try to see, what are the different tables

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
world database has. You'll use, once again, show command, show ‘show tables;'. Let's hit Enter and it will list

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
every single table that belongs to this database. If you remember in MySQL Workbench, we retrieved a few data

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
from City Table. Let's try to do the same over here. Let's retrieve 10 rows from City Tables.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So type ‘SELECT * FROM City LIMIT 10' and hit Enter and it will display you top 10 rows from City Table.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:59:00,000
When you don't have access to the MySQL Workbench, you can quickly use this as a replacement.
