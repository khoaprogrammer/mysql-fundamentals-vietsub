This is Pinal Dave for Pluralsight. In this module we'll get started with MySQL and GUI Tool.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is Fundamentals of MySQL Course so we are assuming that we are all beginners. The biggest issue with any

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
beginner is to start and get going. Similarly, the biggest issue with any developer is to install

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the product, configure it, and get started with it. MySQL installation is very simple and if any developer is

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
not starting learning MySQL because he or she thinks that installation is very complicated or difficult,

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I personally do not agree with it. In this course, we will install MySQL and all related tools live.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We will see how easy and fast the entire process is. Additionally, we will also install and get started

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:59:00,000
using MySQL Workbench. It is the most popular GUI Tool to work with MySQL.
