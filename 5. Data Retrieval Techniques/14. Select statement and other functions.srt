00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So far we have seen SELECT with aggregate functions, as well as doing some static operations.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Now, we will see how we can use SELECT clause with various other functions. For example, we will see functions

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
related to numbers, strings, and dates. One of the interesting challengers we developers have is to eliminate

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
duplicate rows from our resultset. We will see how easy it is to eliminate duplicate rows by adding simple

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:59:00,000
key word, distinct. Now let's go to MySQL Workbench and we will see each of these into action.
