1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Now we will see how we can use MySQL Workbench to edit table data. On the home screen of MySQL Workbench,

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
go to Edit Table Data. I'll select SQLAuthority as my stored connection and we'll click on Next.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Over here, it will give us a few dropdowns where we can select our default schema and tables.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'll select default schema as sakila and table as actor. You can select other table if you prefer.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Now click on Finish. Immediately it has opened up table, actor. You can also see name of the table over here, actor.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Now let's go to the very first row and you can see the first row is edit table. You can change the value if you prefer.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'll leave this actor_id as 1; however, instead of PENELOPE, I will put over here PENELOPE1. Now click on tab.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Instead of GUINESS, I will also put over here GUINESS1. I'll move to line #3 and over here I'll put ED2

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and behind CHASE I'll put 2 again. You can see that now I have edited totals. Now you can see on the screen that

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I have changed PENELOPE to PENELOPE1 and GUINESS to GUINESS1. Do you think this information is committed?

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What I mean by that is that if I go back and select this data again, do you think I will see PENELOPE and GUINESS

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
or I will see PENELOPE1 and GUINESS1? Well, let's go back and check it in Query Editor. Now to write a new query,

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
go to SQL Editor and click on ‘Create a new SQL tab for executing queries'. It will open Code Editor Tab.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Now let's type in a simple query. After selecting the query, click on lightning bolt icon over here.

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It will execute the selected portion of the script or everything if there is no selection. Click here and you can

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
see the result is now displayed in Visual Tab. On Visual Tab, let's look at the first row.

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
First row says PENELOPE and GUINESS. Remember we have changed them to PENELOPE1 and GUINESS1.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We expect to see the changes over here, but they are not over here. The reason is very simple.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let's go back to our actor tab and over here you can still see them, PENELOPE1 and GUINESS1.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Though we have changed the record over here, we are not committed yet. What it means is that the

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
data which have you seen as changed is only in the Query Editor. They are still not propagated to an

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
actual database. To apply them to the actual database, you have to select on Apply.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You can see on the right bottom screen, there is an Apply tab, which is highlighted. Now let's click on Apply.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Apply asks us to give you two updates. You can see over here it has automatically generated two update scripts.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
One is UPDATE ‘sakila'.'actor' SET where ‘first_name' is PENELOPE1 and ‘last_name' is GUINESS1.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
When you scroll on the right, you can see it also has a rare condition where ‘actor_id' is = 1.

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Similar thing is also there for ‘actor_id' = 3. Let's click on Apply. If you do not understand this

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
SELECT statement, don't worry about it. We are going to cover this thing in depth in later modules.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Click on Apply and the screen displays Success. Click on Finish. Now you can see the Apply button is disabled.

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Once again, go to our Ad hoc query, which we have written a few minutes ago and execute it one more time.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
When you executed over here, you can see that line #1 is now changed from PENELOPE and GUINESS to PENELOPE 1

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and GUINESS1. Similar thing for line #3, it's also ED2 and CHASE2. We have learned that how successfully

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
we can edit the row in any table using SQL Editor. On Visual Tab, you can go to any of the cells and double-click

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:56,000
over here. It will make that cell as editable. You can edit the cell and make ED2 to ED and CHASE2 to CHASE.

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Now you can see once again there is an Apply button and a Cancel button. Apply is highlighted and if we click on

36
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Apply, the ED and CHASE will be committed and it will be communicated to the database. If you don't like the changes

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
which we have done, we can easily click on Cancel and you can see they will revert to their original value.

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:24,000
SQL Editor is very powerful. We can also edit it one more way. Click on any line and now go to Edit in the Result Tab.

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Click over here and now that particular cell and complete row is editable. The logic of Apply and Cancel remain

40
00:04:31,000 --> 00:59:00,000
the same in all the cases. In this clip, we have learned three different ways to edit any row in SQL Editor.
