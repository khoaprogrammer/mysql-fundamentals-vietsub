00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Now we will try to understand how Web Application Server works with database with real life example.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's assume you want to check your email. You take your computer, open it, start it, and run your web browser.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In the web browser, you will type your URL address. As soon as you type your URL address, web browser will now

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
send the request. The request will go to internet by your ISP. ISP stands for Internet Service Provider.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Once your request goes to internet, Group Domain Server will now forward that request to Application Server.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This Application Server is where your email application is hosted. Application Server will process all the HTML

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and dynamic pages. The front end of any application is pretty much the same across every single user while using

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
this application. For example, if you are using Gmail, Yahoo or Hotmail, the look and feel will be pretty much

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
the same across every single user of Gmail, Yahoo or Hotmail. However, their emails will be different,

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
the data will be different. You will have data from your friend and other users will have data from their

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
friends and relatives. Data will differ, but the page will look the same. That's exactly what will happen in

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Application Server. It will pass the static HTML's and will pass back the dynamic pages through the

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Application Server. However, every request for data will now go to Database Server.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Database Server will have DBMS or Database Management System. Management System will query user data and

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
will give it back to Database Server. Database Server will later pass back the data to Application Server,

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,000
along with HTML and dynamic page will be returned to internet and at the end will go to web browser of user.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's hard to imagine that there will be any application without any kind of database on the back end.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:59:00,000
As of 2008, MySQL is the most popular Database Management System on planet earth.
