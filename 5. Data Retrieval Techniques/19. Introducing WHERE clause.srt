00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Performance is a very crucial dimension for any application. So far, we have seen in most of the cases, we are

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
retrieving pretty much entire table for our purpose. For that, we use SELECT * FROM table syntax.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We also learned that we should not retrieve columns, which we are not using in our application and use

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
column names in the SELECT statement instead of using SELECT *. There should not be a need of all the rows of

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
the table. Most of the application in most of the cases needs only subset of the rows from the table.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We can limit the number of rows, retrieve by query by using WHERE condition. It is important that we understand

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
how to use WHERE condition very carefully as it will help us tremendously when we are dealing with very last table

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and we want to retrieve only rows, which are required. Let's understand a few of the conditions, which we can use

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:59:00,000
in our WHERE clause.
