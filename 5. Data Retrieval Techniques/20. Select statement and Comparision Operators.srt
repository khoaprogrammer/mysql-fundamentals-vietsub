00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Now we will see how we can use various Comparison Operators into WHERE clause. We can use comparison operators to

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
compare any two expressions. MySQL is good at converting data for comparison; however, it's always a good idea to

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
have both the sides of comparison operators to have the same data type. If the result of the comparison is true,

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the row being tested is integrating query resultset. If the result of comparison is not true, the rows are

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
not included as a part of resultset. If you are comparing numeric value, we will not need single code.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If you are using string, date or similar kind of data type, we may have to wrap our value with single code.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You will see that and understand that into demonstration. Let's see the list of various comparison operators:

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Equal, Less than, Greater than, Less than or Equal to, Greater than or Equal to, and Not equal.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Let's see all of them into action.
