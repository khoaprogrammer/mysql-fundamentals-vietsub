00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
WHERE clause is one of the most powerful clauses in entire SELECT statement. There are lots of interesting

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
elements, which we can use in the WHERE clause to make it interesting to learn. For example, IN phrase.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We can use IN phrase to test whether expression is equal to the value in the least. The order of element in

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
the least does not influence the final resultset. Additionally, we can use subquery in the IN clause as well.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
During demonstration, we will quickly see an example of the same. In the advanced course, we will cover this

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
concept in detail. We can use NOT operator to negate the logic of IN phrase. BETWEEN phrase qualifies the row of

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
a resultset when an expression falls within the range. The lower and the upper limit range expressions are also

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
part of the range. Just like any other operator or phrase, we can use NOT to negate the resultset.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We can use LIKE operator to retrieve rows that matches a string pattern. A string pattern is called a mask.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We will also understand how Wildcard - % (percentage) and _ (underscore) helps to build this string pattern

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
using demonstration. Additionally, we can use NOT keyword before LIKE and negate the entire logic.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
NULL is one of the most interesting concepts within Database. I have seen developers often getting confused

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
with NULL. Incorrect implementation of NULL brings unexpected results. NULL value stands for value that is

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:31,000
unknown or unavailable. It is not a 0 or not an infinite. In SQL, we can't compare NULL by using â€˜equal to' operator.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We are to use special clause of IS NULL and IS NOT NULL. When we use this clause, our resultset contains value

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:59:00,000
based on this logic. Let's quickly jump to a demonstration and understand these concepts.
