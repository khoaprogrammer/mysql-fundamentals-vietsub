00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Now let's see a quick example how MySQL Workbench works. MySQL Workbench has three major workspaces --

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
SQL Development, Data Modeling, and Server Administration. In the SQL Development, we can run queries and

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
modify data; in SQL Modeling, we can create and manage models; and in Server Administration Area, we can do

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
various server-related operations like restarting a server or making a backup. Now let's see a quick example how

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
we can use SQL Development Area. Double-click on our server name, which we have just created

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and it will open SQL Editor. SQL Editor is the area where we will write query to retrieve data, as well as

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
modify data. In this very first initial example, we'll just retrieve few data. On the left side, there's

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Object Explorer and right below it there's an Information area. We can see there are three schemas over here.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's expand World schema. When we expand World schema, we can see Tables, Views, and Routines.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's further expand Tables. Upon expanding Tables, we can see the name of the Tables - City, Country, and

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Country Language. Let's click on City. Upon clicking on the City, in the Information area we can see the

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
definition of the Table City. City has five columns and ID column is an integer in primary key.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's expand City Table as well. Upon expanding City Table, we can see four object groups -- Columns, Indexes,

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Foreign Keys, and Triggers. Let's expand Columns. Here, we can see the same five columns once again.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Click on ID and in Information area you can see the definition of ID. Now let's select data from City.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Right-click over City and select very first option about Selecting Rows. This option automatically brought

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
a simple query for SELECT * FROM world.city and this result is displayed in the Result tab.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This Result tab is also very powerful. You can select any row and get ‘Edit' from the menu over here or

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
‘Insert new row', as well as ‘Delete any row'. Let's try to delete 5th row.

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Select 5th row, click on ‘Delete selected row'. You can see between 4 and 6 there is no row. The row #5 is deleted.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, that's enough for SQL Editor. You will learn about SQL Editor in depth in a later module.

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now very quickly, we'll see a simple example how we can use Server Administration Area.

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Double-click on our connection and it will open Server Administration Area.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Server Administration Area will display as Server Status. Here is the information about our server.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Our server is currently running. You can also see system information, CPU and Memory.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Additionally, there are various vital server information like Connection Usage, Traffic, Query Cache, and

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Key Efficiency are also displayed over here. You can use the same area to startup and shut down my SQL Server as well.

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
There are various Connection Parameters, System Information, Server Logs, and a lot of other Administrative Tasks

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
available in this area. We will explore each of them in a dedicated module. Let's close this one

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and now we are back into MySQL Workbench main screen.
