1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In the real example, we filter columns; in this example, we will filter rows.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
‘SELECT * FROM table name' retrieves every single row and column from table. You can see that in this example where

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm retrieving all the data from sakila.actor table. Here, let me introduce a new clause, which is WHERE clause.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
WHERE clause is nothing but condition. In later part of this module only, we will understand WHERE clause in

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
detail; however, this is a simple example. Let's write the statement from the start.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
SELECT * FROM sakila.actor; what it means is that now we are going to get every single row and every single column

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
from sakila.actor table. Now, let's read the next line, ‘WHERE actor_id &gt; 100'. What it means is that now we will

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
only retrieve from sakila.actor table, those rows where actor_id is greater than 100.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Currently, our sakila.actor table has 200 rows. Now we are talking about retrieving rows only where actor_id

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
is greater than 100. Let's select this statement and execute it. You can see that in the result, our data

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
starts from actor_id 101. Let's quickly scroll down and see if there are any data which is less than 100.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A quick inspection demonstrates that there are no rows which has actor_id greater than 100. What it means is that

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
this WHERE condition has filtered out row where actor_id is 100 or less. Now let's change this greater than to

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
less than and see what result it brings to us. After executing, we can see that we have actor_id 1; however, let's

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
see what is our maximum actor_id. The maximum is 99 because here, we have WHERE condition where we have specified

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,000
that ‘WHERE actor_id &lt; 100'. You can notice that writing WHERE condition is very simple and it's very intuitive.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Let's see the next example. In this example, now we are filtering out fourth column, which is last_update.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We are only selecting actor_id, first_name, and last_name. We have changed here the WHERE condition, now I'm

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
mentioning WHERE first_name = ‘Nick'. What it means is that now we will enter only those rows,

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:25,000
WHERE first_name = ‘Nick' from the table sakila.actor. Let's select this statement and execute it.

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We can see there are three records over here. All three records have first_name as ‘Nick'; however, last_name

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
is different. Additionally, the fourth column of last_updated is also not visible over here.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:59:00,000
It was very easy to see how we can filter rows and columns. (Typing)
