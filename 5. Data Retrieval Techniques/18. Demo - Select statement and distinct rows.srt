00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now in this demonstration, we will understand how DISTINCT keyword impacts query resultset.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Before we execute query, let's look at the Output Window. Go over here in MySQL Workbench and click it here to

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
display Output Window. We'll first execute SELECT first_name FROM sakila.actor. Select the statement and click

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
on Execute. You can see the resultset over here, as well as can notice there are 200 rows returned from this query.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now we will execute second query. The only difference between first query and second query is DISTINCT keyword.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We have additionally added DISTINCT keyword because now we want unique first_name from sakila.actor.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's execute this one and this time, you can notice that we only receive 130 rows. What it means is that there

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
were 70 records, which were duplicate. Now duplicate records are eliminated and we can only see DISTINCT resultsets.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Let's run it again for last_name. Select last_name from sakila.actor and click on Execute.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
From resultset, you can clearly see that ALLEN last_name is there multiple times, as well as BERRY.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Now we will learn another SELECT statement where we have DISTINCT keyword right before the last_name.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Select the query and click on Execute. Now ALLEN is only displayed once, so is BERRY. If you look at the

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Output Window, we can see that when we selected last_name from sakila.actor, at that time MySQL returned 200 rows.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
However, as soon as we added DISTINCT keyword, it has returned us only 123 rows. We can use DISTINCT with multiple

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
columns, as well as with star. The purpose of the DISTINCT is to return unique rows based on the column used

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:59:00,000
in a SELECT statement.
