00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Before we start with our demonstration, let's understand the setup required. You will need MySQL Server,

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
MySQL Workbench, and Sample Database sakila. In my case, I'll use MySQL installer for Windows and in this case,

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
by default, install MySQL Server, Workbench, and all the necessary Sample Database. You can use either of the

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
method, but make sure you do practice all the demos, which you see in this course. Now, open MySQL Workbench,

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
click on your server name, and it will open SQL Editor. This is the screen where we'll be starting most of the demos.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
On the left side on Object Browser, you can see we have sakila Sample Database installed.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Most of the demos of this course will begin with this screen.
