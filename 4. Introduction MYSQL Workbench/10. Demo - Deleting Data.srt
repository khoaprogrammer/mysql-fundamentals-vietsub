00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this clip, we will see how we can delete any row using SQL Editor. We'll be deleting the row, which we have

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
just inserted in the previous clip. Click on the row which you want to delete and once, again, you go to the

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
menu of the Visual Pane. Beside the â€˜Insert new row', there is a minus sign over the grid. Click on this menu icon

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and you can see the row has disappeared. Click on Apply. You can see the SQL for DELETE is generated.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Click on Apply again and it has applied the SQL script to the database. Click on Finish and let's scroll down

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and this time Apply and Cancel are visible. Now you can see how easy it is to select, insert, update, and delete rows

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:59:00,000
in my SQL Workbench.
