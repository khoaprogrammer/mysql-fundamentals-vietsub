00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now let's understand a couple of important features of MySQL Server Administration.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Double-click on the connection, which we have already created, and it will open Server Administration Area.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
On the top of the screen, it displays Server Status. You can see in this INFO section that the name of our Server

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
is SQLAuthority and it is running on a Local Host. Additionally, resin of the Server is also 5.6.10.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The status of our Server is Running. On the very right side, you can see the system has both CPU and memory.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
MySQL Server Health is also displayed right beside it. Connection, Traffic, Query Cache Hit Ratio,

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and Key Efficiency are displayed here. We can quickly see them and get an idea of how Server Health is.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Also, you can see there are four different connections and each connection has a different state.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
One connection has a Query and the other three connections are right now in the sleeping state.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If there is Query, which is taking a lot of resources, you can either kill the query or can kill the complete

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
connection as well. Right below Server Status, there is Startup and Shut Down option.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You can stop your MySQL Server from here, as well as start it. Let's stop our server and start again.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Currently, the Server Status is Running. Click on Stop Server and now you can see the server instance is stopped.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
If you want to start the server instance back, you can just click on Start Server and it will turn on

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
MySQL Server instance. You can use this administration screen to do a lot of other tasks as well.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
For example, you can collect Status and System Variables or you can see Server Logs. If there are any errors,

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
you can find them over here. Additionally, you can configure MySQL Administration's lots of variable over here.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
There are many important settings in this Configuration Area. In MySQL Administration course, we'll go over each

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
of these options and their significance. We'll discuss about Logging, InnoDB, Networking, Advanced settings,

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Other settings, Security-related settings, Application, MyISAM, and Performance-related settings.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I often see developers working hard to tune the SQL queries; however, they absolutely ignored this

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Performance Tab in MySQL Administration. There are many options available in this Configuration Area,

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
which can immediately impact performance very positively. This Server Administration Area also gives you

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
fine control on your Users and their Privilege. You can take a backup and export to database or import your

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
database and restore your MySQL Database from this Data Export/Restore section. Let's click on Home Tab and go

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to the main screen of MySQL Workbench. Well, with this, we'll finish our introduction to MySQL Workbench.
