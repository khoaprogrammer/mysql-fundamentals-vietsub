Hi, this is Pinal Dave for Pluralsight. In this module, we will understand how MySQL Workbench works and

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
various features of it.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In an earlier module, we had a little bit introduction to MySQL Workbench. In this module, we will understand

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
MySQL Workbench a little bit more in depth. Now, the next logical step is to learn about coding and building

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
the database. However, before we move to that one, we need to learn about how we can use MySQL Workbench efficiently

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
to build a work database. MySQL Workbench is a Visual Database Design Tool. It is a three main workspace.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
One is Development, second is Design, and third is Administration. In this module, we will understand each

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:59:00,000
of them a little bit; however, we will spend more time on development-related features of MySQL Workbench.
